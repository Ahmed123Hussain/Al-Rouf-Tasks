Al Rouf Software

Al Rouf is a fictional company used for demonstration. This document describes the mission: to provide simple, local RAG examples for testing. The system ingests text files, chunks them, computes embeddings, and stores them in a FAISS vector index for similarity search.

Features:
- Local embeddings using sentence-transformers
- FAISS index (IndexFlatIP) with cosine similarity
- Small web UI for querying and rebuilding the index
